        <p class="description_text">Today our local park held the 52nd annual Christmas fireworks extravaganza! All I can say is <strong>WOW!</strong> This year the townhip really went above and beyond with their fireworks. They had so many colors, designs, and patterns, it really was a joy to watch. At the finale, there was even a giant firework that was shaped like Santa! I look forward to this every year, and now I am more excited than ever for what the township has in store for us in next years' celebration!</p>

        <p class="description_text">This is the third day of my vacation to the incredible U.S. Virgin Islands. Everything about this trip has been an absolute blast. So far, I've snorkeled, swam, fished, and sailed all over the beautiful water here. Tomorrow I will be scuba diving! I miss al of you at home, but I can't say I miss the cold. See you all in a week!</p>
